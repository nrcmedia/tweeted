== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to easily embed tweets on on a post or page.  Note, this will only embed a single tweet, not the latest tweet.

It automatically styles the twitter posts to one of the many default designs we offer. A theme can override the twitter post design as well by hooking into a filter. (Read Usage Section)

Props to Jonathan Dingman and Dre Armeda (http://wpvibe.com/) for the idea behind this plugin, testing and feedback. Dre Armeda did all of our twitter output designs.
